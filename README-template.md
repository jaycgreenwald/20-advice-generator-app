## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

- 7/31/2022 Start challenge
  - Create repo and 1st commit
  - Watch video to refresh my JSON knowledge https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM
  - Sort out font, font sizes, and colors
  - Sketch out class names
  - Review the change from @import to @use/@forward in SASS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR-a8upNjJ0
  - Learn how to watch for SASS changes not using the typical VSCode Extension https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYWf2m_yzBQ
  - Fix error that prevented script from running https://www.technewstoday.com/cannot-be-loaded-because-running-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system/
  - Report on work in Slack
- 8/1/2022 Day #2
  - Set up dev environment with SASS and Parcel
  - Continued mobile layout adding background images
- 8/2/2022 Day #3
  - Added JavaScript to fetch advice slip from API https://medium.com/@ppt.co.uk/project-walk-through-building-a-simple-advice-slip-generator-cab99c62b8bb
  - Had kidney stone so didn't do much most of the day
  - Read a little more about fetch
- 8/3/2022
  - Finally was able to use API data and update DOM
  - Ran into some problems when I tried to move my changes up to Git. I wasn't prepared for using Parcel.
- 8/4/2022
  - Deleted repo and folder and started fresh without Parcel. I did add a SASS --watch to my folder, but now I know what each file is and where to find it. I'll come back to Parcel in the future.
  - Watched a good video about API calls.
